The dorm rooms are comfortable with wide bunk beds and lockers, there is a fully equipped kitchen with a fridge, a corner for yoga, a cozy chill area and also a surfboard rack. The food is super delicious and the staff was so welcoming. From getting a scooter to find the best waves Max is super friendly and helps you with every issue.",

In total, I spent over 3 weeks here when initially booked for only a few days. The owner Max and the staff are super warm and the best people to hang out with. The coffee and food is excellent!! The location is close to Weligama and Ahangama and can find buses and tuk tuks nearby as well as the train. Would happily extend my stay here if I had more time and would love to come back ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",

Max owner made us feel so at home, and really looks after the people who stay. One night he specially ordered some dinner from the kitchen for me to avoid having to go out in the torrential rain - I was so grateful!! Also, Youkan makes the BEST mango smoothie bowl and chicken salad bowl in all of Midigama üòõ",
